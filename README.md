# PPE Helmet detection Project 
This study aims to develop a framework to sense in real-time the safety compliance of workers with respect to PPE. 
The final model can detect whether the human subject is wearing helmet or not. 


## Description of the project
Transfer learning is used in this project, YOLO V2 is used as the base model, one convolutional layer and the output layer were modified according to current project.
